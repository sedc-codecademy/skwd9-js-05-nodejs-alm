Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. Shawshank slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope."},{"title":"The Hobbit","score":"7","text":"Not great, not terrible.
